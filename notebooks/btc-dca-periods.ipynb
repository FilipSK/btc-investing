    "\n",
    "As usual, bear in mind that **past performance is not indicative of future results**. This article is about evaluating and understanding performance of strategies from an arbitrary point of time in the past until today. Basing your financial decisions solely on this source would be, at best, irresponsible. If you are just looking to get rich quick, buying lottery tickets may be more effective and yield more predictive result than trying to understand Bitcoin.\n",

    "## TL;DR\n",
    "We created an experiment demonstrating that monthly DCA yields statistically better results compared to both weekly and daily strategy. At its best, with an initial investment of $2,500, we will have $248.60 more on average compared to weekly investments, or $380.34 more compared to daily investments. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition of our problem\n",
    "\n",
    "This article is inspired by a question on [r/Bitcoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/dnvfhk/best_way_to_dollar_cost_averaging_monthly_or/) and its \n",
    "aim is to evaluate if choosing a smaller period for investing portions of our lump sum while doing Dollar Cost Averaging, has any effect on our returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose 3 strategies to compare:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We divide our funds into 4 equal portions and invest monthly (every 30 calendar days)\n",
    "2. We divide our funds into 16 equal portions and invest weekly (every 7 calendar days)\n",
    "3. We divide our funds into 120 equal portions and invest daily\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have $2,500 to invest\n",
    "- We already decided, that we want to Dollar Cost Average. See our article on [comparing Bitcion investment strategies](https://shitcoin.ninja/post/2019/10/comparing-bitcoin-investment-strategies/) for more information on this subject.\n",
    "- We do not take price of money, opportunity costs or inflation into account. (This would marginally investments with less portions / longer periods)\n",

    "There we have it. Overall, monthly DCA yields statistically better results compared to both weekly and daily strategy. At its best, with an initial investment of $2,500, we will have $248.60 more on average compared to weekly investments, or $380.34 more compared to daily investments. That is more than 10% of gain compared to the 2 other strategies!\n",
